## Overview

I applied for Founders and Coders after comming across a recommendation as I wanted 
to learn more amongst people who also wanted to purse a career in development - I also 
love a challenge and surprising myself with my capabilities. 

I decided to go for a simpler, one-page template as I did start less than a month before the deadline 
so I didn't want to make things harder for myself as time was running out. I did link a few projects 
that needed their separate files, as it was more organised and allowed my to explore different themes 
and features to make them both appealing and functional.

### The challenge

- Create a website of my own style.
- Using only HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Demonstrated my learnings through a series of projects that developed through key learning outcomes.

## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- I learned that I could attach the event listener onclick in the html which made my layout look clean and put together::

```html
<div class="btn" onclick="opentab()">
<div class="btn" onclick="signUpPrompt()">
```

### What I found challenging

- I tried to implement my 'Comment Section' onto my main HTML file, but was unable to so I linked it to a seperate file and it worked out perfectly!
- Using JavaScript to add movies in the 'Movie Data' without needing to input them invidually.
- Looking through code to see that '.' had to be replaced with '-' or anything mispelt (it reminded me of the Princess and the Pea - you can't rest until you find the tiny error!)
